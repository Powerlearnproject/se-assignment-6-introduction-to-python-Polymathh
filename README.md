# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.
   Python is a high-level programming language known for its simplicity and readability. Key features include versatility (web development, data analysis), ease of learning, extensive libraries (like NumPy for scientific computing), and automation (scripting). It excels in AI (machine learning with TensorFlow), web apps (Django), and automation (scripting tasks)

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
   Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.

3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.
   print("Hello, World!")

4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.
Basic data types in Python include:

Integer: Whole numbers (int). Example: num = 10
Float: Decimal numbers (float). Example: pi = 3.14
String: Sequence of characters (str). Example: message = "Hello"
Boolean: True or False values (bool). Example: is_active = True
python
Copy code
num = 10
pi = 3.14
message = "Hello"
is_active = True

print(num)
print(pi)
print(message)
print(is_active)
5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.
Conditional statements in Python allow you to execute certain blocks of code based on the evaluation of conditions. The primary conditional statements are if, elif (else if), and else.

Example of an if-else statement:
6. Functions in Python:
   - unctions in Python are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks. They improve code organization, readability, and reusability by encapsulating logic. Example:

python
Copy code
# Function to calculate sum of two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Example of calling the function
result = add_numbers(5, 3)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 8
Functions simplify complex tasks, enhance code clarity, and promote modular programming, making Python code more efficient and maintainable.







7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.
   Lists:

Ordered collection of items.
Elements accessed by index.
Elements can be duplicated.
Defined using square brackets [].
Example: numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Dictionaries:

Unordered collection of key-value pairs.
Elements accessed by keys.
Keys must be unique; values can be duplicated.
Defined using curly braces {} with key-value pairs separated by colons :.
Example: person = {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}.

8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.
Exception handling in Python manages and responds to errors that occur during program execution. It prevents abrupt termination and allows graceful error recovery
9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.
   Modules are Python files containing functions, classes, or variables. Packages are directories of modules with an __init__.py file. Importing allows access to module contents:

10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.
o read from and write to files in Python:

Reading from a file:

python
Copy code
# Reading from a file
with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:
    content = f.read()
    print(content)
Writing to a file:

python
Copy code
# Writing to a file
lines = ['Line 1', 'Line 2', 'Line 3']
with open('output.txt', 'w') as f:
    for line in lines:
        f.write(line + '\n')
# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
